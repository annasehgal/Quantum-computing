# What is Quantum Computing?
* Quantum computing uses the principles of quantum physics to perform calculations, offering potential for solving problems that are intractable for classical computers. It leverages concepts like superposition and entanglement to process information in a way that classical computers cannot, potentially leading to faster or more efficient solutions. 

### End of Moore's Law:     
 The "end of Moore's Law," which states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles roughly every two years, doesn't necessarily mean the end of progress in computing. While miniaturization of transistors is approaching physical limits, quantum computing represents a potential paradigm shift. Quantum computing offers a new way to perform calculations, using quantum bits (qubits) instead of classical bits, potentially leading to faster and more efficient solutions for certain types of problems.
